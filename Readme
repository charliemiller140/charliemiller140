Step 1: 
Create Ansible host (Linux - Ubuntu)
Break this down into each site e.g 

[Example Police station 1]
[Switches]
switch-1 ansible_host=x.x.x.x (Managment IP)
switch-2 ansible_host=x.x.x.x (Managment IP)

[Example Police Station 2]
Switch-1 ansible_host=x.x.x.x (Managment IP)


Step 2:
Add users and SSH keys to box for each device (Use Ansible vault for encrtpyion)

Step 3: 
Add all switches into Ansible host file

Step 4: 
Create Playbooks to automate jobs

An example of showing versions for all switches
---

- name: Cisco show version example
  hosts: Example Site 1
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: run show version on the routers
      ios_command:
        commands: show version | incl Version
      register: output

    - name: print output
      debug:
        var: output.stdout_lines
		
Step 5:
Ping all devices to ensure connectivity to test

Step 6: 
Test playbooks with a small selection of cisco devices

Step 7:
Push out site by site

or 

Do in batches locally e.g in the office 15+ at a time
They will need to enable SSH and add a username for access

Playbooks = code that carries tasks and decides who it applies to
.YAML = File format of the playbooks with a spesfic syntax
Ansible vault = Enctyped password bank
